<h1>Shenxiang Wang'Profile</h1>

<p>I am from Ningbo City Vocational and Technical College.</p>
<h2>Address：9XueFu Road, South Eduction Park,Ningbo,Zhejiang. P,R.China 315600</h2>
  
<h1>Eduction:</h1>
<p>College degree that has passed the courses of the first year of university and the second year of university.</p>
  <h1>Three favorite courses</h1>
<p>basketball, soccer, and programming. Because I love basketball and football, football and basketball allow me to relax enough and contribute to our physical health. Programming was a course I had never been exposed to, which made me have a lot of curiosity</p>
  <h1>My strengths:</h1> 
  <p>I love sports, know a lot about basketball and football, and like to discuss learning difficulties with my classmates. </P>
  <h1>Disadvantages: </h1>
  <p> Lack of hands-on ability, my hands-on ability is very weak, there are very few artistic cells. </p>
  <h1>Overcome my weaknesses and take advantage of my strengths：</h1>
  <p>Because my hands-on ability is not strong and I lack artistic cells, I often choose to participate in some art exhibitions, learn handicraft classes, and exercise my ideas and patience. I will often discuss various problems with my classmates, identify problems and solve problems in my studies or life.</p>
